## UX

## Strategy
Using the core UX principles I first started with Strategy, thinking about the target audience for this community app and the features they would benefit from.

The target audience for 'Mush!App' are:
- Average age group 38 years old
- People that would like to know more about fungi
- People that enjoy growing mushroom kits

These users will be looking for:
- An informative website, with information that is easy-to-find & concise
- Reviews, with essential information such as knowledge level, location and growing method
- A form to write a review
- A way to contact the admin
- The ability to make a user account to edit their account

This website will offer all of these things whilst also allowing for intuitive navigation and comfortability of use. 

Due to the age group of the users, it is assumed that most users will be viewing the site on their mobile phones and therefore creating something responsive is integral to the design, I have used Bootstrap grids and elements & custom CSS to allow for this.
